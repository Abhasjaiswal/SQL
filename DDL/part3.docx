Constraints 
Constraints in databases are rules or conditions that must be met for data to be inserted, updated, or deleted in a database table. They are used to enforce the integrity of the data stored in a database and to prevent data from becoming inconsistent or corrupted.

1. NOT NULL
The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value. This means that every row in the table must have a value for that column.

2. UNIQUE 
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique. This means that no two rows in the table can have the same value for that column.

3. PRIMARY KEY
The PRIMARY KEY constraint is a combination of the NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints. It ensures that a column (or a combination of columns) has a unique value for each row in the table, and that the column cannot have a NULL value.

4. FOREIGN KEY
The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to create a relationship between two tables. It ensures that the values in a column (or a combination of columns) in one table match the values in a column (or a combination of columns) in another table.

5. CHECK
The CHECK constraint is used to specify a condition that must be met for the data in a column to be valid. This condition can be any valid SQL expression.

6. DEFAULT
The DEFAULT constraint is used to specify a default value for a column. If a value is not provided for the column when a new row is inserted, the default value will be used.

7. AUTO INCREMENT
The AUTO INCREMENT constraint is used to automatically generate a unique value for a column when a new row is inserted. This is commonly used for primary key columns.


REFERNTIAL ACTIONS 
There are five referential actions that can be taken when a row in a parent table is deleted or updated:

1. CASCADE: When a row in the parent table is deleted or updated, the corresponding rows in the child table are also deleted or updated.

2. SET NULL: When a row in the parent table is deleted or updated, the corresponding rows in the child table have their foreign key columns set to NULL.

3. SET DEFAULT: When a row in the parent table is deleted or updated, the corresponding rows in the child table have their foreign key columns set to the default value specified for the column.

4. RESTRICT: Prevents the deletion or update of a row in the parent table if there are corresponding rows in the child table.
